Hardhat 3 is production-ready and you can migrate today! We'll keep it in beta status as we work on missing features and stabilize it in the near future.

:::

## Overview

Hardhat 3 is a complete rewrite of Hardhat 2. While many features are familiar, several fundamental changes mean the new version is not compatible with Hardhat 2 projects out of the box:

- **ESM-first**: Your Hardhat config must be an ES module. Scripts and JavaScript/TypeScript tests can still be CommonJS, but ESM is the default.
- **Declarative config**: Plugins, tasks, and other extensions are configured explicitly in your config instead of being registered by side effects.
- **Explicit network connections**: You create and manage network connections yourself, allowing multiple concurrent connections in one process, but meaning that `hre.network` no longer represents a single network connection that is immediately available.
- **Extensibility through hooks**: Features like `extendConfig` and subtask overriding were replaced by the new hooks system. Adding new fields to the Hardhat Runtime Environment with `extendEnvironment` is no longer possible, but the typical use cases for extending it can be covered by other mechanisms.

Because these changes are significant, this guide recommends starting with a clean config and migrating features step by step, rather than trying to adapt an Hardhat 2 project in place.

## Before starting the migration

Before making any changes, prepare your project so that installing and running Hardhat 3 wonâ€™t conflict with leftover dependencies, configs, or build artifacts from Hardhat 2.

1. **Check node.js version**

   Make sure you are using Node.js v22.10.0 or later:

   ```sh
   node --version
   ```

2. **Clear caches and artifacts**

   Run the `clean` task to avoid issues with stale artifacts or caches:

   <Run command="hardhat clean" />

3. **Remove Hardhat 2 dependencies**

   Start by removing these packages from your `package.json`:
   - `hardhat`
   - Any packages starting with `hardhat-`, `@nomicfoundation/`, or `@nomiclabs/`
   - `solidity-coverage`

   Then reinstall and check for remaining packages that depend on Hardhat:

   <Run command={["install", "why hardhat"]} />

   Repeat until no Hardhat-related dependencies remain.

4. **Rename your old config**

   Keep your old config for reference, but rename it so you can create a new one alongside it:

   ```sh
   mv hardhat.config.js hardhat.config.old.js
   ```

5. **Make your project ESM**

   Add `"type": "module"` to your `package.json`.

6. **(Optional) Adapt your `tsconfig.json`**

   If you have a `tsconfig.json` file, make sure that `compilerOptions.module` is set to an ESM-compatible value like `"node16"`.

## Setting up Hardhat 3

With your npm project ready, you can start setting up Hardhat 3.

1. **Install Hardhat 3**

   Run the following command to install Hardhat 3:

   <Install packages="hardhat" />

2. **Create an empty config file**

   Create a `hardhat.config.ts` file with the following content:

   ```ts
   import type { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";

   const config: HardhatUserConfig = {};

   export default config;
   ```

3. **Run the help command**

   Verify that Hardhat 3 is working by running the help command:

   <Run command="hardhat --help" />

## Progressively migrating your config

With a minimal version of Hardhat 3 working, you can migrate your config bit by bit.

Let's start with the minimal settings required to compile your contracts.

1. **Add a `solidity` entry**

   Copy the `solidity` entry from your old config as-is. The format is backwards-compatible in Hardhat 3, so it should just work:

   ```ts
   const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
     solidity: {
       /* your solidity config */
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Compile your contracts**

   Run the `build` task to verify that your config is working:

   <Run command="hardhat build" />

To learn more about the updated config format, and continue with your migration, please take a look at [this section](/docs/reference/configuration#solidity-configuration).

## Migrating tests

This section assumes that your Hardhat 2 project uses Mocha as its tests runner, which is the default experience.

1. **Install the recommended toolbox for Mocha and Ethers.js**

   Install the plugin:

   <Install packages="@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers" />

   Then in your Hardhat config, import the plugin and add it to the list of plugins:

   ```ts
   import type { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
   import hardhatToolboxMochaEthers from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers";

   const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
     plugins: [hardhatToolboxMochaEthers],
     solidity: {
       /* your solidity config */
     },
   };
   ```

   Notice that, unlike Hardhat 2, it's not enough to just import the plugin in the config. You also have to add it to the list of plugins.

2. **Update your test files**

   This is usually the most involved part of the migration, and so it has [its own page](/docs/migrate-from-hardhat2/guides/mocha-tests) with the details.

   You can start by migrating a single test and run it individually to verify that it works as expected:

   <Run command="hardhat test test/some-test.ts" />

{/* A section was removed here until we have setInlineAction. Take a look at the git history to restore it. */}

## Migrating `extendConfig` and `extendEnvironment`

These extensibility points were replaced by the hook system. We'll add details on how to migrate them soon.

## Migration blockers

If your migration is blocked by a missing feature or plugin, please let us know [in this issue](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/7207).
