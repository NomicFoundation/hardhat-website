This website contains the documentation for Hardhat 3, the new major version of Hardhat.

You can find the documentation for [Hardhat 2 here](https://v2.hardhat.org).

### Hardhat 2 support

We encourage everyone to migrate to Hardhat 3, but if you need to keep using Hardhat 2, we got you covered.

Hardhat 2 will be suppported until the [Glamsterdam hardfork](https://forkcast.org/upgrade/glamsterdam) gets activated on Ethereum Mainnet.
