If you have used **Buidler** before, we invite you to skip this tutorial, [clone our boilerplate repository](#) and start coding asap.

Welcome to our beginners guide to smart contract development. Before we start, you should be capable to:

  1. code in [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics),
  2. open a [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator),
  3. clone a [`git`](https://git-scm.com/doc) repository and
  4. understand [smart contracts](https://ethereum.org/learn/#smart-contracts).

If you can't do any of the above, follow the links and take some minutes to get to the basics. Still here? Well, keep reading.

This tutorial will introduce you into smart contract development through the building of a real decentralized application (dapp). We will start simple by setting up your environment but at the end you will be able to build dapps from scratch.
