::: warning BUIDLER USERS
If you have used **Buidler** before, we invite you to skip this tutorial, [clone our boilerplate repository](#) and start coding asap.

Welcome to our beginners guide to smart contract development. Before we start, you should be capable to:

  1. code in JavaScript,
  2. open a terminal,
  3. clone a Git repository,
  4. understand smart contracts and
  5. follow a tutorial.

If you can't do any of the above — specially step 5 — please refer to the [Guidelines](./0-guidelines/) section. There you will find some insightful links to follow. Still here? Well, keep reading.

This tutorial will introduce you into smart contract development through the building of a real decentralized application (dapp). Amazing, right? We will start simple by setting up your environment but at the end you will be able to build dapps from scratch.
