# 3. Creating a Buidler project

In the same folder where you installed **Buidler** run:

```
npx buidler
```

You will see the following output, move down with your keyboard, select `Create an empty buidler.config.js` and hit enter.


```{15}
$ npx buidler

## Tasks
Every time you're running **Buidler** from the CLI you're running a task. E.g. `npx buidler compile` is running the `compile` task. To see the currently available tasks in your project, run `npx buidler`. Feel free to explore any task by running `npx buidler help [task]`. 

::: tip
You can create tasks by defining them inside`buidler.config.js`. For some ideas, you could create a task to reset the state of a development environment, interact with your contracts or package your project.

## Plugins
The bulk of **Buidler's** functionality comes from plugins, which as a developer you're free to choose the ones you want to use. **Buidler** is unopinionated in terms of what tools you end up using, but it does come with some built-in defaults. All of which can be overriden.

For this tutorial, we are going to install two plugins (ether.js and Waffle) and some needed libraries. We will explain their functionality later, for now install them by running:

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/buidler-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/buidler-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
```

Add the following statement to your `buidler.config.js`:

```js {1}
usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");

module.exports = {};
```

## Setting up Typescript (optional)
Skip this section if you want to continue with plain JavaScript and go straight forward to: [4. Creating and compiling contracts.](../4-contracts/)

Install the required Typescript dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript @types/node @types/mocha
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the project root:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["./scripts", "./test"],
  "files": [
    "./buidler.config.ts"
  ]
}
```

Rename the config file:

```
mv buidler.config.js buidler.config.ts
```

Open it and make it typesafe with the follwing code:

```js
import { BuidlerConfig, usePlugin } from "@nomiclabs/buidler/config";

usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");

const config: BuidlerConfig = {};

export default config;
```

Done! You are ready for the next step.
