## Mining blocks

### `mine`

Mines a specified number of blocks with an optional time interval between them.

Type:

```ts
mine(blocks?: NumberLike, options?: { interval?: NumberLike }): Promise<void>
```

Parameters:

- `blocks`: The number of blocks to mine. Defaults to 1 if not specified.
- `options.interval`: Configures the interval (in seconds) between the timestamps of each mined block. Defaults to 1.

Returns: A promise that resolves once the blocks have been mined.

Example:

```ts
// Mine 1 block (default behavior)
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();
await networkHelpers.mine();

// Mine 10 blocks with an interval of 60 seconds between each block
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();
await networkHelpers.mine(10, { interval: 60 });
```

### `mineUpTo`

Mines new blocks until the latest block number reaches `blockNumber`.

Type:

```ts
mineUpTo(blockNumber: NumberLike): Promise<void>
```

Parameters:

- `blockNumber`: The target block number to mine up to. Must be greater than the latest block's number.

Returns: A promise that resolves once the required blocks have been mined.

Example:

```ts
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();

await networkHelpers.stopImpersonatingAccount("0x123...");
```

## Snapshots

### `takeSnapshot`

Takes a snapshot of the blockchain state at the current block.

Type:

```ts
takeSnapshot(): Promise<SnapshotRestorer>
```

Returns: A promise that resolves to a `SnapshotRestorer` object, which contains a `restore` method to reset the network to this snapshot.

Example:

```ts
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();
const snapshot = await networkHelpers.takeSnapshot();
await snapshot.restore(); // Restores the blockchain state
```

### `clearSnapshots`

Clears every existing snapshot.

Type:

```ts
clearSnapshots(): void
```

Example:

```ts
// Clear all saved snapshots
clearSnapshots();
```

## Fixtures

### `loadFixture`

Executes a fixture function and restores the state to a snapshot on subsequent calls.

The `loadFixture` function is useful in tests where you need to set up the blockchain to a desired state (like deploying contracts, minting tokens, etc.) and then run multiple tests based on that state.

It executes the given fixture function, which should set up the blockchain state, and takes a snapshot of the blockchain. On subsequent calls to `loadFixture` with the same fixture function, the blockchain is restored to that snapshot rather than executing the fixture function again.

The fixture function receives the connection object as its only argument, allowing you to interact with the network.

**Do not pass anonymous functions as the fixture function.** Passing an anonymous function like `loadFixture(async () => { ... })` will bypass the snapshot mechanism and result in the fixture being executed each time. Instead, always pass a named function, like `loadFixture(deployTokens)`.

Type:

```ts
type Fixture<T> = (connection: NetworkConnection) => Promise<T>;

loadFixture(fixture: Fixture<T>): Promise<T>
```

Parameters:

- `fixture`: A named asynchronous function that sets up the desired blockchain state and returns the fixture's data.

Returns: A promise that resolves to the data returned by the fixture, either from execution or a restored snapshot.

Example:

```ts
async function setupContracts({ viem }: NetworkConnection) {
  const contractA = await viem.deployContract("ContractA");
  const contractB = await viem.deployContract("ContractB");
  return { contractA, contractB };
}

const { contractA, contractB } = await loadFixture(setupContracts);
```

## Manipulating blocks

### `dropTransaction`

Removes the given transaction from the mempool, if it exists.

Type:

```ts
dropTransaction(txHash: string): Promise<boolean>
```

Parameters:

- `txHash`: Transaction hash to be removed from the mempool.

Returns: `true` if successful, otherwise `false`.

Example:

```ts
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();
const success = await networkHelpers.dropTransaction("0x123...");
```

### `setBlockGasLimit`

Sets the gas limit for future blocks.

Type:

```ts
setBlockGasLimit(blockGasLimit: NumberLike): Promise<void>
```

Parameters:

- `blockGasLimit`: The gas limit to set for future blocks.

Returns: A promise that resolves once the gas limit has been set.

Example:

```ts
const { networkHelpers } = await hre.network.connect();
await networkHelpers.setBlockGasLimit(1000000); // Set block gas limit to 1,000,000
```

### `setCoinbase`

Sets the coinbase address to be used in new blocks.

Type:

```ts
