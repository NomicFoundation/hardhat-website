# 3. Creating a Buidler project

In the same directory where you installed **Buidler** run:

```
npx buidler
```

Select `Create an empty buidler.config.js` with your keyboard and hit enter.


```{15}
$ npx buidler

Let's go through the two main concepts before we start using this file.

## Tasks
Every time you're running **Buidler** from the CLI you're running a task. E.g. `npx buidler compile` is running the `compile` task. To see the currently available tasks in your project, run `npx buidler`. Feel free to explore any task by running `npx buidler help [task]`. 

::: tip
You can create your own tasks. Check out the [Creating a task](/guides/create-task.md) guide.

## Plugins
The bulk of **Buidler's** functionality comes from plugins, which as a developer you're free to choose the ones you want to use. **Buidler** is unopinionated in terms of what tools you end up using, but it does come with some built-in defaults. All of which can be overriden.

For this tutorial we are going to use the Ethers.js and Waffle plugins. They'll allow you to interact with Ethereum and to test your contracts. We'll explain how they're used later on. To install them, in your project directory run:

```
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/buidler-ethers ethers @nomiclabs/buidler-waffle ethereum-waffle chai
```

Add the highlighted line to your `buidler.config.js` so that it looks like this:

```js {1}
usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");

module.exports = {};
```

<!---
## Setting up TypeScript (optional)
Skip this section if you want to continue with plain JavaScript and go straight forward to: [4. Creating and compiling contracts.](../4-contracts/)


Install the required Typescript dependencies:

```
npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript @types/node @types/mocha
```

Create a `tsconfig.json` file in the project root:

```js
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["./scripts", "./test"],
  "files": [
    "./buidler.config.ts"
  ]
}
```

Rename the config file:

```
mv buidler.config.js buidler.config.ts
```

Open it and make it typesafe with the follwing code:

```js
import { BuidlerConfig, usePlugin } from "@nomiclabs/buidler/config";

usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");

const config: BuidlerConfig = {};

export default config;
```

Done! You are ready for the next step.
