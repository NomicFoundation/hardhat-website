import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

The Hardhat `node` task starts a local development node that runs until you stop it, exposing an HTTP-based JSON-RPC server for your scripts and applications to connect to.

## Using the node task

Suppose you have a script that sends 1 ETH from the first local account to the zero address and then prints its balance:

```ts
// my-script.ts
import { network } from "hardhat";

const { viem } = await network.connect();
const publicClient = await viem.getPublicClient();
const [wallet] = await viem.getWalletClients();

await wallet.sendTransaction({
  to: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  value: 10n ** 18n,
});

const zeroAddressBalance = await publicClient.getBalance({
  address: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
});

console.log(`Balance of zero address: ${zeroAddressBalance}`);
```

If you run this script multiple times, the output won't change:

<Run command="hardhat run my-script.ts" />

To run a simulated network that persists beyond a single task, start a node in one terminal:

<Run command="hardhat node" />

Then, in another terminal, run your script using the `--network localhost` option, which connects to the running node:

<Run command="hardhat run my-script.ts --network localhost" />

Now, if you run the script again while the node is running, you'll see the output change each time, as the state is preserved between runs.

## Configuring the local development node

There are two ways to configure the local development node:

1. By passing options to the `node` task
2. By configuring the `node` network in your Hardhat config

To pass options to the `node` task, you just run it with them, like this:

<Run command="hardhat node --chain-id 123" />

You can see the complete list of options by running:

<Run command="hardhat node --help" />

To configure it in your Hardhat config, add a `node` network. For example, to use the `123` chain ID:

```ts
// hardhat.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "hardhat/config";

export default defineConfig({
  networks: {
    node: {
      type: "edr-simulated",
      chainId: 123,
    },
  },
});
```

The type of the `node` network config must be `edr-simulated`. To learn about all the config values, read the [Network configuration reference](/docs/reference/configuration#network-configuration).

## Running a development node programmatically

In addition to using the `hardhat node` task, you can start a development node programmatically using the Network Manager's `createServer` method. This method creates a local simulated network and exposes it through an HTTP-based JSON-RPC server, just like `hardhat node`.

Here's a complete example that creates a server, runs it for 60 seconds, and then closes it:

```ts
// scripts/server.ts
import { network } from "hardhat";

// Create a JsonRpcServer wrapping a blockchain simulation based on the
// "default" Network Config, with `loggingEnabled` setting overridden to `true`
const server = await network.createServer(
  {
    network: "default",
    override: { loggingEnabled: true },
  },
  // hostname and port are optional parameters
  // "127.0.0.1",
  // 8545,
);

const { address, port } = await server.listen();
console.log(`JSON-RPC running in: http://${address}:${port}`);

// Example of closing the server from another async context
console.log("Closing the server in 60 seconds");
setTimeout(async () => {
  await server.close();
}, 60_000);

// Wait for the server to close before printing a message
await server.afterClosed();
console.log("Server closed");
```

Run this script with:

<Run command="hardhat run scripts/server.ts" />

While the server is running, you can connect to it through HTTP, for example using `--network localhost`, or any client with its address and port.
