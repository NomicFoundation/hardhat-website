# Node.js support

Hardhat 3 launches with the support of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) `node --version` ≥ `v22.10.0` and `node --version` ≥ `v24.0.0`.

After launch, Hardhat 3 will support all subsequent even major versions of Node.js, while they are labeled as `Current`, `Active LTS` and `Maintenance`. This support activates with the launch of Node.js `v26` and will continue thereafter.
