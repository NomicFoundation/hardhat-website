import Run from "@hh/Run.astro";

Global Options are options that Hardhat can receive and are available across all of its functionality.

They are different from Hardhat Task options and arguments in that they are meant to control the functionality of Hardhat itself, and not that of a single task.

For example, `--network` is a global option that controls the default value that `network.connect()` uses when no network config name is provided.

Plugins can define their own Global Options, so the complete list depends on your setup. To see all available options, run:

<Run command="hardhat --help" />

## Core Global Options

### Verbosity

The `--verbosity` (or `-v`) option controls the amount of output shown during test execution, script runs, and deployments when using Hardhat Network. Use `-v` flags to increase the verbosity level. For example, `-vvv` sets level 3, and `-vvvvv` sets level 5. The default level is 2.

**For tests** (`hardhat test`):

| Flag | Level | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| (none) | 0-2 | No call traces (level 2 is the default: shows logs) |
| `-vvv` | 3 | Execution traces for failing tests only |
| `-vvvv` | 4 | Execution traces for all tests + setUp traces for failing tests |
| `-vvvvv` | 5 | All traces (execution + setUp) for all tests |

**For non-test tasks** (`hardhat run`, `hardhat ignition deploy`, etc.):

| Flag | Level | Effect |
|------|-------|--------|
| (none) | 0-2 | No call traces |
| `-vvv` | 3 | Call traces for failing transactions only |
| `-vvvv` / `-vvvvv` | 4-5 | All call traces |

<Run command="hardhat test -vvv" />

<Run command="hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts -vvvvv" />


The verbosity option is available on any Hardhat command. You can also use the long form:

<Run command="hardhat test --verbosity 3" />

:::tip

Call traces show the sequence of contract function calls made during a transaction, which is invaluable for debugging why a transaction reverted or understanding complex contract interactions.

:::

:::note

The `--verbosity` flag only produces output when using Hardhat Network (the built-in EDR-based local network). It does not apply to external networks like mainnet forks via URL, testnets, or tasks that don't involve network connections (e.g., `hardhat build`, `hardhat clean`).

## Global Options and environment variables

Global Options can also be provided using environment variables formatted like `HARDHAT_<SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE>`. For example, you can run:

<Run
  prefix="HARDHAT_NETWORK=localhost"
  command="hardhat run script/my-script.ts"
/>

If both the environment variable and the command line argument are provided, the latter takes precedence.
