# Getting help

We value the community of Hardhat plugin authors and support their efforts to build on top of Hardhat. If you need help with your plugins, here's how to get it.

## Joining the Hardhat 3 plugin authors Telegram group

You can join the [Hardhat 3 plugin authors Telegram group](/plugin-authors-group).

This group is focused on plugin development, so please ask general Hardhat questions in the appropriate channel. To keep the discussion on topic, we'll remove messages unrelated to plugin development.

## Reporting problems on GitHub

If you think you've found a bug in Hardhat, please report it. You can do so by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/issues/new).

Before reporting a bug, follow these steps to ensure a new report is needed:

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Hardhat and its plugins. Your problem may already be fixed.

- Determine whether the issue comes from a plugin by running your project with some of them disabled.

- Search GitHub for other reports of the same problem. If you find one, comment on the existing issue instead of creating a new one.
